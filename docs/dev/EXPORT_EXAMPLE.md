## Conversation

**User (22:30)**
I'm feeling really anxious about tomorrow's presentation. Can't sleep, mind racing.

**Assistant (22:31)**
I hear you're experiencing anxiety about tomorrow's presentation. Let me reflect back what I'm hearing:

- Presentation tomorrow causing stress
- Mind racing, preventing sleep
- High level of concern

Quick baseline check:
- What's your SUDS level right now (0-10)?
- How many hours of sleep did you get last night?

**User (22:32)**
SUDS is probably 8. Only got 4 hours last night. Been preparing all week but still feel unprepared.

**Assistant (22:33)**
An 8 is quite high - that's significant distress. The combination of sleep deprivation and anxiety is tough. Let's address both:

Sleep deprivation makes anxiety worse, and anxiety makes sleep harder - it's a cycle we can break.

For tonight specifically:
1. Let's do a quick grounding exercise
2. Set realistic expectations about tomorrow
3. Plan for better sleep tonight

**User (22:35)**
That makes sense. What grounding exercise would help?

**Assistant (22:36)**
Perfect. Let's try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique:

Look around and name:
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

Take your time with each one. This brings you back to the present moment.

**User (22:38)**
Okay, trying it now... I can see my laptop, coffee mug, lamp, bookshelf, window. Touching keyboard, desk surface, chair armrest, phone. Hearing fan humming, street traffic, clock ticking. Smelling coffee, fresh air from window. Tasting... mint from earlier.

Actually feeling a bit calmer now. SUDS maybe down to 6.

**Assistant (22:39)**
Great work - you engaged fully with that exercise! Notice how your SUDS dropped from 8 to 6. That's your nervous system responding to grounding.

Your presentation prep is done. More studying now won't help - it will just increase anxiety.

For tonight:
1. Set a firm stop time (30 mins from now)
2. Light stretching or brief walk
3. Cool room, no screens 1 hour before sleep
4. If mind races: "I've prepared enough, sleep helps me perform"

How does that sound?

**User (22:41)**
Yeah, you're right. I need to trust the prep I've done. Going to close the laptop after this and do some stretching. Thanks for the reality check.
