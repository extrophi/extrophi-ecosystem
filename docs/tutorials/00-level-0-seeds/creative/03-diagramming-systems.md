## Capstone Project

**Comprehensive Diagramming Portfolio**

Create diverse diagram collection demonstrating range:

1. **Standard Diagram Types** (10+ diagrams):

   **a) Process and Flow**:
   - Software development workflow
   - User journey map
   - Decision tree
   - Swim lane diagram

   **b) Structure and Hierarchy**:
   - System architecture
   - Information architecture
   - Organizational hierarchy
   - Database schema (ERD)

   **c) Concepts and Relationships**:
   - Mind map (50+ nodes)
   - Concept map showing connections
   - Venn diagram comparison
   - Causal loop diagram

2. **Systems Thinking Analysis**:
   - Choose complex system (e.g., social media, climate, economy)
   - Map components and relationships
   - Identify feedback loops
   - Show stocks and flows
   - Highlight leverage points
   - Written analysis (1000+ words)

3. **Tool Mastery**:
   - **Digital whiteboard**: Collaborative brainstorm diagram
   - **Diagramming software**: Technical architecture
   - **Code-based**: Mermaid or PlantUML examples (5+)
   - **Hand-drawn**: Scanned concept sketches

4. **Diagram Library**:
   - 20+ reusable templates
   - Consistent style guide
   - Icon library for diagrams
   - Color palette and conventions
   - Documentation of when to use each type

5. **Real-World Application**:
   - Document existing system at work/school
   - Propose improvement with before/after diagrams
   - Explain technical concept to non-technical audience
   - Facilitate visual brainstorming session

**Deliverables**:
- Portfolio of 20+ diverse diagrams
- Systems thinking case study
- Multi-tool diagram examples
- Reusable template library
- Diagramming style guide
- Presentation using diagrams to explain complex topic
