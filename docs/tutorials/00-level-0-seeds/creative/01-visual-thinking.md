## Capstone Project

**Visual Thinking Portfolio**

Build diverse collection of visual thinking artifacts:

1. **Icon Library** (50+ icons):
   - People (10): various roles, emotions
   - Objects (10): common items
   - Concepts (10): abstract ideas
   - Actions (10): verbs and processes
   - Containers (10): frames, speech bubbles
   - Consistent style throughout

2. **Sketchnotes** (5+ examples):
   - TED Talk or lecture notes
   - Book chapter summary
   - Meeting or brainstorm session
   - Podcast episode notes
   - How-to or tutorial

3. **Visual Explanations** (5+ types):
   - **Process Flow**: Multi-step procedure
   - **Comparison**: Options or alternatives
   - **Timeline**: Events over time
   - **Hierarchy**: Organization or taxonomy
   - **Concept Map**: Related ideas and connections

4. **Problem-Solving Sketches**:
   - Visual brainstorm session (divergent thinking)
   - Design challenge sketches (UI, process, system)
   - Decision-making visualization
   - Before/after improvement sketch

5. **30-Day Visual Practice**:
   - Daily visual thinking exercise
   - Variety of subjects and styles
   - Progressive skill building
   - Reflection on growth

**Deliverables**:
- Icon library (digital or scanned)
- 5+ polished sketchnotes
- 5+ visual explanation examples
- Problem-solving sketch collection
- 30-day practice journal
- Final portfolio presentation (visual, of course!)

## Prerequisites

- No drawing experience required
- Willingness to look "messy"
- Paper and pens (or digital tablet)
- Curiosity and playfulness
- Patience with practice

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you should be ready for:
- **Sketching Skills**: Drawing fundamentals, perspective, shading
