## Capstone Project

**100 Sketches in 30 Days**

Comprehensive sketching practice program:

1. **Daily Sketching Practice** (30 days, 3-4 sketches/day):

   **Week 1: Fundamentals**
   - Days 1-3: Basic forms (cubes, spheres, cylinders)
   - Days 4-5: Household objects from observation
   - Days 6-7: One-point perspective practice

   **Week 2: Observation**
   - Days 8-10: Still life setups (3 objects each)
   - Days 11-12: Plants and organic forms
   - Days 13-14: Architecture and buildings

   **Week 3: Figure and Movement**
   - Days 15-17: Gesture drawing (30 sec, 1 min, 5 min)
   - Days 18-19: Hands and feet studies
   - Days 20-21: Full figure sketches

   **Week 4: Integration and Ideas**
   - Days 22-24: Urban sketching (cafes, streets, etc.)
   - Days 25-27: Imagination and concept sketches
   - Days 28-30: Personal project sketches

2. **Skill Development Exercises**:
   - **Line Control**: 50 lines of varying weights
   - **Form Studies**: 10 variations of each basic form
   - **Perspective**: 5 two-point perspective scenes
   - **Value Studies**: 10 gradient exercises
   - **Speed Sketches**: 20+ one-minute sketches

3. **Observation Studies** (10+ detailed):
   - Complex objects (tools, machines, etc.)
   - Natural forms (shells, rocks, plants)
   - Interior spaces
   - Outdoor scenes
   - Self-portraits

4. **Documentation**:
   - Daily photo of sketches
   - Weekly reflection notes
   - Progress comparison (day 1 vs day 30)
   - Favorite sketches selection
   - Lessons learned journal

5. **Final Project**:
   - Choose subject of personal interest
   - Create 5+ detailed sketches exploring it
   - Show progression from thumbnail to refined
   - Write artist statement

**Deliverables**:
- 100+ sketches (photographed/scanned)
- Daily practice log
- Before/after comparison
- 10+ detailed observation studies
- Final project series (5+ sketches)
- Reflection essay on growth

## Prerequisites

- Visual Thinking basics helpful but not required
- No previous drawing experience needed
- Paper and pencils/pens
- Willingness to make "bad" drawings
- Observation and patience

## Next Steps
