- Data minimization
- Secure deletion and data recovery

**Skills**:
- Implement backup strategy
- Securely delete sensitive files
- Evaluate cloud services for privacy

## Section 8: Operational Security (OpSec)

**Concepts**:
- Compartmentalization and least privilege
- Metadata and what it reveals
- Digital footprint and OSINT
- Privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA basics)

**Skills**:
- Minimize digital footprint
- Review privacy settings on social media
- Understand data rights and requests

## Capstone Project

**Personal Security Audit and Implementation Plan**

Conduct comprehensive security audit and implement improvements:

1. **Inventory Phase**:
   - List all online accounts and services
   - Document devices and operating systems
   - Identify sensitive data locations
   - Map current security measures

2. **Audit Phase**:
   - Check for password reuse (using Have I Been Pwned)
   - Review MFA status on all accounts
   - Assess browser privacy configuration
   - Evaluate backup strategy
   - Test phishing awareness

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Set up password manager and migrate passwords
   - Enable MFA on 10+ critical accounts
   - Configure browser privacy settings
   - Enable full-disk encryption
   - Establish backup routine
   - Install privacy-focused tools

4. **Documentation**:
   - Threat model for personal situation
   - Security posture before/after comparison
   - Maintenance checklist (quarterly reviews)
   - Emergency access plan

**Deliverables**:
- Written security audit report
- Implemented security improvements (screenshots)
- Personal threat model document
- Quarterly security maintenance checklist

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Access to personal devices and accounts
- Willingness to change habits
- 2-4 hours for implementation time

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you should be ready for:
- **Application Security Basics**: OWASP Top 10, secure coding
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, VPNs, network monitoring
- **Cryptography Fundamentals**: Public key infrastructure, certificates
- **Incident Response**: Breach response, data recovery
- **Advanced Privacy**: Tor, air-gapped systems, OpSec for activists
- **Security Automation**: Vulnerability scanning, security scripts
