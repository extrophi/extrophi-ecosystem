## Capstone Project

**Critical Thinking Portfolio**

Demonstrate critical thinking across contexts:

1. **Argument Analysis** (5+ examples):
   - News article analysis
   - Political speech critique
   - Advertisement deconstruction
   - Social media post evaluation
   - Academic paper argument mapping

   For each:
   - Identify claims and premises
   - Evaluate evidence quality
   - Spot fallacies or biases
   - Assess argument strength
   - Alternative perspectives

2. **Fallacy Collection** (20+ examples):
   - Find real-world fallacies
   - Categorize by type
   - Explain why fallacious
   - Rewrite without fallacy
   - Document sources

3. **Bias Awareness Journal** (30 days):
   - Daily bias identification
   - Personal decision analysis
   - Bias mitigation strategies tested
   - Reflection on improvement
   - Patterns observed

4. **Decision Analysis** (3+ major decisions):
   - Document decision process
   - List options and criteria
   - Evaluate evidence
   - Consider opportunity costs
   - Explain final choice
   - Review decision post-outcome

5. **Socratic Dialogue** (3+ conversations):
   - Record questioning session
   - Transcript with analysis
   - Questions asked and why
   - Assumptions uncovered
   - Insights gained

6. **Position Paper Evolution**:
   - Choose controversial topic
   - State initial position
   - Research opposing views
   - Steelman strongest counterarguments
   - Revise position based on evidence
   - Document thinking evolution

**Deliverables**:
- Argument analysis portfolio (5+ analyses)
- Fallacy collection with examples
- 30-day bias journal
- Decision analysis reports (3+)
- Socratic dialogue transcripts
- Position evolution essay (2000+ words)
- Reflection on critical thinking growth

## Prerequisites
