## Capstone Project

**Personal Pattern Library**

Build comprehensive pattern collection:

1. **Code Pattern Collection** (20+ patterns):

   **Categories**:
   - Algorithms (10): Sort, search, graph, tree
   - Data Structures (5): Array, linked list, tree, hash
   - Design Patterns (5): Factory, Observer, Decorator, etc.

   For each pattern:
   - Name and description
   - Use cases and when to apply
   - Code example (2+ languages)
   - Complexity analysis
   - Variations and alternatives

2. **Problem-Solving Pattern Library** (15+ patterns):
   - Two pointers
   - Sliding window
   - Divide and conquer
   - Dynamic programming
   - Backtracking
   - Greedy approach
   - BFS/DFS
   - Binary search variants

   For each:
   - Problem signature (how to recognize)
   - Template solution
   - 3+ example problems solved
   - Common variations
   - Edge cases

3. **Mental Models Collection** (20+ models):
   - First principles
   - Second-order thinking
   - Inversion
   - Circle of competence
   - Margin of safety
   - Compound interest
   - Network effects
   - Pareto principle

   For each:
   - Model explanation
   - Application examples (work, life, learning)
   - When useful vs not
   - Related models

4. **Pattern Recognition Case Studies** (10+):
   - Identify pattern in real situation
   - Document pattern characteristics
   - Show how pattern guided solution
   - Generalize to pattern template
   - Add to library

5. **Cross-Domain Pattern Mapping**:
   - Find same pattern in different domains
   - Map relationships between patterns
   - Create pattern hierarchy
   - Visual pattern network

**Deliverables**:
- Digital pattern library (website or wiki)
- 20+ code patterns with examples
- 15+ problem-solving patterns with templates
- 20+ mental models with applications
- 10+ case studies
- Pattern relationship map
- Pattern index and search
