- Evolve system over time
- Keep notes useful

## Capstone Project

**Build Personal Knowledge Management System**

Create comprehensive, personalized note system:

1. **System Design Document**:
   - Goals and use cases (learning, work, personal)
   - Method selection (Zettelkasten, PARA, hybrid)
   - Tool choice with justification
   - Folder/tag structure
   - Workflow documentation
   - Backup and sync plan

2. **Implementation**:
   - Set up chosen tool
   - Create folder/tag taxonomy
   - Design note templates (5+ types)
   - Configure sync and backup
   - Set up quick capture methods

3. **Note Collection** (100+ notes over 30 days):

   **Note Types**:
   - **Literature Notes** (30+): From books, articles, videos
   - **Permanent Notes** (20+): Atomic ideas from reflection
   - **Project Notes** (10+): Work/study project documentation
   - **Daily Notes** (30): Journal, log, quick captures
   - **Reference Notes** (10+): Cheat sheets, how-tos

4. **Linking and Structure**:
   - Create 50+ meaningful links between notes
   - Build 3+ Map of Content (MOC) notes
   - Tag system with 20+ tags
   - Index or dashboard note
   - Orphan note management

5. **Output Creation**:
   - Write 3+ articles/essays from notes
   - Create presentation from note network
   - Build guide or tutorial synthesizing notes
   - Share knowledge publicly (blog post, etc.)

6. **System Documentation**:
   - Personal note-taking manual
   - Templates and examples
   - Workflow diagrams
   - Maintenance schedule
   - Review process

**Deliverables**:
- Fully implemented note system
- 100+ notes created
- 50+ meaningful links
- 3+ MOC notes
- 3+ outputs created from notes
- System documentation
- 30-day usage reflection

## Prerequisites

- Basic writing skills
- Willingness to experiment
- Commitment to daily practice
- Digital tool access (free tools available)
- Curiosity about ideas and connections
