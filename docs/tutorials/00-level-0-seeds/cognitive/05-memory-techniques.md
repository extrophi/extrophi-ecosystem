     - Language learning (100+ vocab)
     - Facts and trivia (history, science)
     - Concepts and definitions
   - 30-day consistent practice
   - Review analytics and retention rates
   - Deck optimization documentation

2. **Memory Palace Construction** (3+ palaces):
   - **Palace 1**: Personal info (passwords, PINs, important data)
   - **Palace 2**: Learning content (course material, book)
   - **Palace 3**: Professional knowledge (industry terms, processes)

   For each:
   - Location description
   - Content stored (20+ items)
   - Walk-through video
   - Retrieval test results

3. **Name Memory Challenge**:
   - Meet 50+ new people over 30 days
   - Remember all names using techniques
   - Test recall at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
   - Document success rate and methods
   - Reflection on what worked

4. **Impressive Memory Feats** (complete 3+):
   - Memorize 50-digit number
   - Learn 100 words in new language
   - Memorize deck of cards (or 30+ cards)
   - Remember 20+ historical dates
   - Recall 30-item shopping list

5. **Learning Acceleration Project**:
   - Choose skill to learn (language, programming, instrument)
   - Apply memory techniques throughout
   - Document learning progress (30+ days)
   - Compare to previous learning experiences
   - Measure improvement quantitatively

6. **Memory Technique Guide**:
   - Personal memory technique handbook
   - Step-by-step guides for each method
   - Examples from own practice
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Resources and next steps

**Deliverables**:
- Active Anki deck (200+ cards, 30 days)
- 3 documented memory palaces
- 50-person name recall log
- 3+ memory feat demonstrations (video)
- Learning acceleration case study
- Personal memory technique guide
- Reflection on memory improvement

## Prerequisites
