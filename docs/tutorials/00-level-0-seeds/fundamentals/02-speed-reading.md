# Tutorial Outline: Speed Reading

**Category**: Fundamentals
**Level**: 0 (Seed)
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 hours (spread over 4-6 weeks)

## Learning Objectives

- Double reading speed while maintaining comprehension
- Eliminate subvocalization and regression habits
- Use strategic reading techniques for different materials
- Improve focus and reduce distractions while reading
- Critically evaluate reading speed vs comprehension tradeoffs

## Section 1: Reading Mechanics

**Concepts**:
- How the eye moves during reading (saccades, fixations)
- Subvocalization and mental pronunciation
- Regression and back-skipping
- Peripheral vision and visual span

**Skills**:
- Identify personal reading habits
- Measure baseline reading speed (WPM)
- Assess comprehension levels

## Section 2: Eliminating Bad Habits

**Concepts**:
- Subvocalization reduction (not elimination)
- Stopping regression and re-reading
- Finger pointing and guide techniques
- Mental distractions and focus

**Skills**:
- Reduce subvocalization consciously
- Use pacer to prevent regression
- Maintain forward momentum

## Section 3: Expanding Visual Span

**Concepts**:
- Fixation points and eye landing zones
- Peripheral vision utilization
- Chunking: reading word groups vs individual words
- Visual processing capacity

**Skills**:
- Increase words per fixation (1 → 3-5)
- Use peripheral vision for word recognition
- Practice chunking exercises

## Section 4: Scanning and Skimming

**Concepts**:
- Scanning for specific information
- Skimming for main ideas
- Pre-reading and previewing
- When to use each technique

**Skills**:
- Scan documents for keywords/data
- Skim articles for gist in seconds
- Preview material before deep reading

## Section 5: Strategic Reading

**Concepts**:
- Different speeds for different materials
- Reading goals and purpose
- Active reading and annotation
- SQ3R method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)

**Skills**:
- Adjust speed based on content difficulty
- Set reading goals before starting
- Use active reading strategies

## Section 6: Comprehension Techniques

**Concepts**:
- Speed vs comprehension balance
- Memory encoding during reading
- Mental summarization
- Main idea identification

**Skills**:
- Summarize passages after reading
- Identify key points and themes
- Answer comprehension questions accurately

## Section 7: Focus and Environment

**Concepts**:
- Reading environment optimization
- Distraction management
- Reading fatigue and breaks
- Lighting and ergonomics

**Skills**:
- Create distraction-free reading space
- Maintain focus for 30+ minutes
- Take strategic breaks to maintain comprehension

## Section 8: Practice and Measurement

**Concepts**:
- Measuring progress (WPM, comprehension %)
- Deliberate practice for speed reading
- Plateaus and breakthrough techniques
- Long-term maintenance

**Skills**:
- Track reading speed and comprehension
- Practice with progressively harder materials
- Maintain improvements over time

## Capstone Project

**4-Week Speed Reading Challenge**

Complete structured program to double reading speed:

1. **Baseline Assessment** (Week 0):
   - Test reading speed on 3 different text types
   - Comprehension assessment (questions)
   - Identify specific bad habits (regression count, etc.)
   - Set personal goals (target WPM, comprehension %)

2. **Weekly Practice Schedule**:
   - **Week 1**: Eliminate subvocalization and regression
     - 30 min daily practice with pacer
     - Timed reading exercises
     - Comprehension checks

   - **Week 2**: Expand visual span and chunking
     - Word group exercises
     - Peripheral vision training
     - Increase fixation span to 3-5 words

   - **Week 3**: Strategic reading techniques
     - Practice scanning and skimming
     - Apply SQ3R method to articles
     - Vary speeds by material type

   - **Week 4**: Integration and real-world application
     - Read 5+ articles/chapters at higher speed
     - Maintain comprehension above 70%
     - Apply to work/study materials

3. **Reading Diversity**:
   - Fiction novel (narrative comprehension)
   - Technical article (detail retention)
   - News article (main idea extraction)
   - Academic paper (critical reading)

4. **Metrics and Analysis**:
   - Daily WPM tracking
   - Comprehension scores per session
   - Progress charts (speed over time)
   - Before/after comparison

5. **Final Demonstration**:
   - Read 1000-word article in under 3 minutes
   - Answer 10 comprehension questions (8+/10 correct)
   - Provide verbal summary of main points
   - Compare to baseline (show improvement)

**Deliverables**:
- 4-week practice log with daily metrics
- Before/after reading test results
- Progress visualization graphs
- Summary of 10+ books/articles read
- Personal speed reading guide
- Video of reading test demonstrating speed

## Prerequisites

- Proficient reading ability at normal speed
- 20-30 hours over 4-6 weeks
- Access to diverse reading materials
- Commitment to daily practice
- Baseline reading speed 200+ WPM

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you should be ready for:
- **Advanced Speed Reading**: 1000+ WPM techniques, PhotoReading
- **Critical Reading**: Analysis, argument evaluation
- **Research Skills**: Academic reading, literature reviews
- **Note-Taking Systems**: Cornell, sketchnoting, Zettelkasten
- **Memory Techniques**: Retention strategies, spaced repetition
- **Reading Lists**: Curated reading for skill development
