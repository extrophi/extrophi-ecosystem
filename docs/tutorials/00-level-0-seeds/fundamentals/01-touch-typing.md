- Maintain daily practice habit

## Capstone Project

**30-Day Touch Typing Transformation**

Complete structured 30-day program with:

1. **Daily Practice Routine** (30 min/day):
   - Week 1-2: Home row + top/bottom rows (accuracy focus)
   - Week 3-4: Full keyboard + numbers (speed building)
   - Week 5-6: Code typing + real-world practice

2. **Metrics Tracking**:
   - Daily WPM and accuracy scores
   - Progress charts and graphs
   - Error pattern analysis
   - Personal records

3. **Real-World Application**:
   - Type 10+ emails without looking
   - Complete coding exercises via typing
   - Write 1000-word blog post
   - Take notes during meeting/lecture

4. **Skill Demonstrations**:
   - Type paragraph at 60+ WPM, 95%+ accuracy
   - Code typing test (JavaScript/Python)
   - Blind typing challenge (keyboard covered)
   - 10-minute sustained typing session

5. **Final Assessment**:
   - Typing test certification (TypeRacer, Monkeytype)
   - Self-recorded video of typing
   - Reflection on improvement journey
   - Maintenance plan for continued practice

**Deliverables**:
- 30-day practice log with daily scores
- Progress visualization (charts/graphs)
- Before/after typing test results
- Video demonstration of 60+ WPM typing
- Personal typing tips document

## Prerequisites

- Computer with keyboard
- 30-40 hours available over 6-8 weeks
