## Capstone Project

**30-Day Deep Work Challenge**

Build deep work practice from scratch:

1. **Baseline Assessment** (Week 0):
   - Track current focus ability (max uninterrupted time)
   - Count daily distractions
   - Measure current deep work hours/week
   - Identify biggest focus challenges
   - Set deep work goals (hours/week target)

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - **Physical**: Dedicated workspace, minimal design
   - **Digital**: Distraction blockers, focus tools
   - **Social**: Communicate boundaries to others
   - **Ritual**: Design startup/shutdown routines
   - Documentation with photos/screenshots

3. **Progressive Deep Work Practice** (4 weeks):

   **Week 1: Foundation (1 hour/day)**
   - Single daily deep work block
   - Track distractions and triggers
   - Practice shutdown ritual
   - Reflection notes daily

   **Week 2: Extension (2 hours/day)**
   - Two 1-hour blocks or one 2-hour block
   - Eliminate top 2 distractions
   - Morning routine optimization
   - Attention training exercises

   **Week 3: Quality (2-3 hours/day)**
