## Capstone Project

**66-Day Habit Transformation**

Build 5+ habits over 66 days:

1. **Habit Selection and Design** (5 habits):

   **Categories**:
   - Health: Exercise, diet, sleep
   - Productivity: Morning routine, deep work
   - Learning: Reading, skill practice
   - Relationships: Connection, communication
   - Personal: Meditation, journaling, gratitude

   For each habit:
   - Specific behavior (what, when, where)
   - Trigger/cue identification
   - Minimum viable version
   - Progressive scaling plan
   - Reward system
   - Success metrics

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Remove friction from good habits
   - Add friction to bad habits to break
   - Visual cues placement (photos/documentation)
   - Tool/app configuration
   - Social accountability setup

3. **Implementation Schedule**:

   **Week 1-2**: Habit 1 (anchor/keystone)
   - Daily practice
   - Tracking and reflection
   - Troubleshooting

   **Week 3-4**: Add Habit 2 (stack on Habit 1)
   - Maintain Habit 1
   - Build Habit 2
   - Stack intentionally

   **Week 5-6**: Add Habit 3
   **Week 7-8**: Add Habit 4
   **Week 9-10**: Add Habit 5

4. **Tracking System**:
   - **Daily**: Habit tracker (checkmarks)
   - **Weekly**: Reflection and adjustment
   - **Data Captured**:
     - Completion (yes/no/partial)
     - Difficulty (1-10)
     - Satisfaction (1-10)
     - Notes and insights
     - Missed habit reasons

5. **Bad Habit Breaking** (1-2 habits):
   - Identify habit to break
   - Understand triggers and rewards
   - Design replacement habit
   - Track reduction/elimination
   - Document strategies that work

6. **Progress Documentation**:
   - Before/after photos (where applicable)
   - Streak tracking visualizations
   - Habit strength self-assessment
   - Identity shifts observed
   - Life impact analysis

**Deliverables**:
- 5 habit design documents
- Environment modification documentation
- 66-day habit tracking log
- Weekly reflection notes
- Bad habit breaking case study
- Progress photos/evidence
- Final transformation report

## Prerequisites

- Honest self-assessment
- Commitment to 66-day practice
- Willingness to start small
- Self-compassion for setbacks
- Long-term thinking
