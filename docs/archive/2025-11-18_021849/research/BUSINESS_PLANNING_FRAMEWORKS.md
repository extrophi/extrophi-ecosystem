# Business Planning Frameworks Research

**Research Date**: 2025-11-16
**Purpose**: Enable voice-to-business-plan workflows in BrainDump v3.0
**Focus**: Lean Canvas, AI-assisted planning, structured ideation workflows

---

## Executive Summary

This research explores frameworks and tools for transforming voice brain dumps into structured business plans. Key findings:

1. **Lean Canvas** is ideal for startup ideation (9 blocks, problem-focused)
2. **Voice-to-plan workflow** is a market gap - no major tool offers this natively
3. **AI prompts** can structure unstructured voice transcripts into actionable plans
4. **Open-source tools** exist for markdown-based canvas generation
5. **Validation framework** (40% "very disappointed" rule) should guide the process

## 1. Lean Canvas Model (Ash Maurya)

### Overview

The Lean Canvas adapts Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas specifically for startups. Unlike the traditional BMC which focuses on business infrastructure, Lean Canvas emphasizes **problem-solution fit** - crucial for early-stage validation.

### Prompt Template for Transcript Processing

```markdown
## BUSINESS IDEA EXTRACTION PROMPT

You are an expert business strategist analyzing a voice transcript from an entrepreneur's brain dump session. Extract structured business information from the unstructured thoughts.

### Input Transcript:
[INSERT RAW TRANSCRIPT HERE]

### Extract the following (respond in JSON format):

{
  "problems": {
    "identified": [
      {
        "description": "",
        "who_affected": "",
        "frequency": "",
        "current_solution": "",
        "emotional_intensity": "high/medium/low",
        "validation_status": "assumed"
      }
    ],
    "confidence_score": 0.0
  },
  "customers": {
    "segments_mentioned": [
      {
        "description": "",
        "demographics": "",
        "psychographics": "",
        "is_early_adopter": true/false
      }
    ],
    "confidence_score": 0.0
  },
  "solution": {
    "features_mentioned": [],
    "unique_aspects": [],
    "technology_stack": "",
    "confidence_score": 0.0
  },
  "revenue": {
    "models_discussed": [],
    "pricing_mentions": [],
    "confidence_score": 0.0
  },
  "competition": {
    "competitors_named": [],
    "differentiation_points": [],
    "confidence_score": 0.0
  },
  "gaps_identified": [
    "Missing information about X",
    "Unclear Y"
  ],
  "suggested_follow_up_questions": [
    "Have you talked to potential customers about X?",
    "How would you price this?"
  ],
  "overall_readiness": "ideation/validation/execution",
  "lean_canvas_blocks_filled": ["problem", "customer_segments"],
  "lean_canvas_blocks_empty": ["revenue_streams", "channels", "key_metrics", "cost_structure", "unfair_advantage", "solution", "unique_value_proposition"]
}

### Guidelines:
- Only extract what is explicitly mentioned
- Mark assumptions with validation_status: "assumed"
- Confidence scores should reflect clarity of information (0.0-1.0)
- Suggest specific follow-up questions for gaps
- Highlight contradictions or unclear statements
```

### Canvas Auto-Population Algorithm

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for canvas population

function populateLeanCanvas(extractedData) {
  const canvas = new LeanCanvas();

  // Map extracted data to canvas blocks
  if (extractedData.problems.confidence_score > 0.5) {
    canvas.problem = formatProblems(extractedData.problems.identified);
    canvas.problemAlternatives = extractAlternatives(extractedData.problems);
  }

  if (extractedData.customers.confidence_score > 0.5) {
    canvas.customerSegments = formatSegments(extractedData.customers.segments_mentioned);
    canvas.earlyAdopters = filterEarlyAdopters(extractedData.customers);
  }

  if (extractedData.solution.confidence_score > 0.5) {
    canvas.solution = formatFeatures(extractedData.solution.features_mentioned);
  }

  // Generate UVP if problem + solution exist
  if (canvas.problem && canvas.solution) {
    canvas.uniqueValueProposition = generateUVP(canvas.problem, canvas.solution);
  }

  // Track completion
  canvas.completionPercentage = calculateCompletion(canvas);
  canvas.prioritizedGaps = prioritizeGaps(extractedData.gaps_identified);

  return canvas;
}

function prioritizeGaps(gaps) {
  const priority = {
    'problem': 1,      // Most critical
    'customer_segments': 2,
    'unique_value_proposition': 3,
    'solution': 4,
    'revenue_streams': 5,
    'key_metrics': 6,
    'channels': 7,
    'cost_structure': 8,
    'unfair_advantage': 9  // Can develop over time
  };

  return gaps.sort((a, b) => priority[a.block] - priority[b.block]);
}
```

## 8. Product-Market Fit Validation Framework

### The Lean Startup Three Stages

```
STAGE 1: Problem-Solution Fit
├─ Do customers have the problem?
├─ Is the problem worth solving?
├─ Will they pay for a solution?
└─ Validation: Customer interviews (10+)

STAGE 2: Product-Market Fit
├─ Does your solution solve the problem?
├─ Do customers use it repeatedly?
├─ Would 40%+ be "very disappointed" without it?
└─ Validation: Sean Ellis test, retention metrics

STAGE 3: Growth
├─ Can you acquire customers efficiently?
├─ Is LTV:CAC > 3:1?
├─ Can you scale channels?
└─ Validation: Unit economics, growth metrics
```

### Customer Discovery Questions

**Problem Validation (Stage 1)**
1. "Tell me about the last time you experienced [PROBLEM]"
2. "How do you currently solve this problem?"
3. "What's the hardest part about [TASK]?"
4. "Why is that frustrating for you?"
5. "How much time/money do you lose to this problem?"

**Solution Validation (Pre-MVP)**
6. "If I could [SOLUTION PROMISE], would that be useful?"
7. "What would be missing from that solution?"
8. "Who else on your team would need to approve this?"
9. "What would stop you from using this?"
10. "How much would you expect to pay for this?"

**Product-Market Fit (Post-MVP)**
11. "How disappointed would you be if you could no longer use [PRODUCT]?"
12. "What would you use as an alternative?"
13. "Who do you think would benefit most from this?"
14. "How would you describe [PRODUCT] to a colleague?"
15. "What nearly stopped you from signing up?"

### Red Flags in Customer Discovery

| Warning Sign | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| "That's interesting" | Politeness, not enthusiasm |
| "I would definitely use that" | Future promise, not commitment |
| "My friend needs this" | Deflection, not personal pain |
| "How much will it cost?" (too early) | Price shopping, not problem-focused |
| Can't recall specific incident | Problem may not be real |

### Green Flags

| Positive Sign | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| Describes specific recent incident | Problem is real and fresh |
| Already tried multiple solutions | Active problem-solver |
| Asks about timeline | Urgency to solve |
| Offers to pay for early access | Strong commitment |
| Wants to show colleagues | Internal champion potential |

## Summary

This research establishes that voice-to-business-plan workflows represent a **significant market gap**. While AI business plan generators exist, none offer:

1. **Voice input** as primary interface
2. **Local processing** for privacy
3. **Iterative validation** tracking
4. **Lean Startup methodology** integration

BrainDump is uniquely positioned to become the first **privacy-first, voice-native business planning tool** by integrating:
- Existing transcription capabilities (Whisper.cpp)
- AI extraction prompts (Claude/OpenAI)
- Structured Lean Canvas storage
- Validation tracking workflow

The combination of voice journaling for creative ideation and AI-assisted structuring could make BrainDump invaluable for entrepreneurs, founders, and product managers who need to quickly capture and validate business ideas while maintaining complete privacy over sensitive business information.

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement basic Lean Canvas data model
2. Create extraction prompt library
3. Build canvas visualization UI
4. Test with real business ideation sessions
5. Iterate based on user feedback
