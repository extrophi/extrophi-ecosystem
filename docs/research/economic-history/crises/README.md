### [The Great Depression (1929-1939)](great-depression.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

**The Crash**: Black Tuesday (Oct 29, 1929) - Dow loses 89% peak-to-trough

**Causes (Debated)**:
- Stock market speculation, margin buying
- Agricultural overproduction, falling prices

### [Stagflation (1970s)](stagflation.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

**The Paradox**: High inflation + high unemployment + low growth (contradicts Phillips curve)

**Triggers**:
- 1973 OPEC oil embargo → price shocks
- 1971 Nixon Shock → end of Bretton Woods, dollar devaluation
- Loose monetary policy (1960s) → inflation expectations

**Keynesian Crisis**:
- Phillips curve breaks down
- Fiscal stimulus fails to reduce unemployment without worsening inflation
- "Misery Index" (inflation + unemployment) peaks >20%

**Theoretical Shift**: ⚡⚡
- **Monetarism rises**: Friedman's "inflation is always monetary" gains credibility
- **Rational expectations** (Lucas, Sargent) challenges Keynesian policy effectiveness
- **Supply-side economics** (Laffer curve) influences Reagan/Thatcher

**Policy Response**:
- Paul Volcker (Fed Chair 1979-87): Raise rates to 20%, break inflation
- Severe recession (1981-82) but inflation falls from 14% to 3%

**Peak Absurdity**:
- Super Bowl 2000: 14 dot-com ads

## Crisis Patterns

### Stages of a Financial Crisis (Kindleberger-Minsky Model)

1. **Displacement**: New opportunity (technology, policy change)
2. **Boom**: Easy credit, rising prices, "this time is different"
3. **Euphoria**: Irrational exuberance, leverage peaks
4. **Profit-taking**: Insiders sell, warning signs ignored
5. **Panic**: Sudden realization, rush for exit, contagion
6. **Revulsion**: Overshooting to downside, paralysis

### Common Features

- **Credit expansion** precedes crashes
- **Leverage** amplifies both boom and bust
- **Contagion** spreads via interconnected systems
- **Regulatory lag** - innovation outpaces oversight
- **Cognitive biases** - recency, anchoring, herding

### Post-Crisis Patterns

- **Regulatory reform** (often watered down over time)
- **Paradigm shift** in economic thought
- **Political realignment** (populism, extremism)
- **Technological innovation** (crises spur disruption)
