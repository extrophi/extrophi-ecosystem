## How to Use These Documents

These foundational concepts appear across multiple historical periods and schools of thought. When reading topic-specific documents, refer back here to understand the core principles being debated.

### Recommended Reading Order

**For beginners**:
1. Money
2. Supply & Demand
3. Interest & Usury
4. Public Goods

**For intermediate**:
5. Comparative Advantage
6. The Business Cycle
7. Game Theory in Economics

**Cross-cutting themes**:
- Mathematical formalization increases over time (1870s marginalism → 1950s game theory)
- Behavioral economics challenges rational agent assumptions (2000s)
- Political and moral dimensions often excluded from mathematical models
