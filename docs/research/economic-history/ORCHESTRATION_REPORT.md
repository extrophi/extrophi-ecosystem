## Document Template

Created comprehensive **authoring guide** with:

### Structural Sections
- Overview, Historical Context, Core Concepts
- Key Figures, Evolution & Development
- Debates & Controversies, Real-World Examples
- Impact & Legacy, Critiques & Limitations
- Cross-References, Further Reading
- Visual Aids, Discussion Questions
- Status & Metadata

### Tone Guidelines
- Balanced (multiple perspectives)
- Evidence-based (cite sources)
- Critical (question assumptions)
- Accessible (write for intelligent layperson)
- Honest (acknowledge uncertainty)

### Quality Standards
- Minimum 1500 words for major topics
- At least 5 sources cited
- Minimum 5 cross-references
- At least one case study
- Present 2+ schools' perspectives on contested topics

### Visual Elements
- Mermaid diagrams (timelines, flowcharts, concept maps)
- Tables (comparisons, data)
- Blockquotes (definitions, key quotes)

---

## Cross-Referencing System

### Bidirectional Links
Every document links to related topics AND is linked back from those topics.

**Example**: Bitcoin document links to:
- Austrian School (philosophical influence)
- Satoshi Nakamoto (creator)
- Nixon Shock (fiat currency crisis)
- Cypherpunks (movement context)
- QE (post-2008 response)

And each of those documents links back to Bitcoin.

### Link Density
- **Foundations**: 5-10 links per document (foundational = referenced everywhere)
- **Schools of Thought**: 8-15 links (intellectual genealogies)
- **Crises**: 10-20 links (multi-causal, trigger paradigm shifts)
- **Figures**: 5-10 links (to schools, works, influenced thinkers)
- **Crypto**: 8-12 links (interdisciplinary: tech, econ, politics)

**Total estimated links**: 500+ across entire knowledge base

---

## Balanced Perspective Framework

### Contested Topics Get Multi-View Treatment

**Example: Business Cycle Explanations**
- **Classical**: Self-correcting, Say's Law
- **Keynesian**: Aggregate demand shocks
- **Austrian**: Credit expansion malinvestment
- **Monetarist**: Monetary policy errors
- **Post-Keynesian**: Minsky's financial instability
- **Real Business Cycle**: Technology shocks

Each view presented fairly, then evidence examined.

### Philosophical Questions Highlighted
- What gives money value?
- Is economics a science or ideology?
- Can markets be truly free?
- Is infinite growth possible?
- Does capitalism require inequality?

**Approach**: Present arguments, acknowledge uncertainty, avoid false certainty

---

## Unique Features

### 1. Crypto Integration
Unlike traditional economic history, this knowledge base treats cryptocurrency as:
- Serious monetary experiment (not dismissed)
- Ideological response to 2008 crisis
- Continuation of debates (Austrian vs. Keynesian, gold vs. fiat)
- Parallel to CBDCs (centralized vs. decentralized visions)

### 2. Heterodox Inclusion
Political economy section gives equal weight to:
- Institutional, Ecological, Feminist, Post-Keynesian schools
- Not relegated to footnotes; treated as valid perspectives
- Critiques of mainstream blind spots

### 3. Crisis-Centric Learning
Crises are not "exceptions" but **central learning events**:
- Expose flaws in prevailing models
- Trigger paradigm shifts
- Reveal power dynamics
- Test theories against reality

### 4. Historical Depth
Starts with Mesopotamia (3000 BCE), not Adam Smith (1776):
- Shows money, credit, markets have ancient origins
- Islamic finance innovations often ignored
- Continuity and rupture across millennia

### 5. Interdisciplinary
Connects economics to:
- **Philosophy** (moral debates on usury, inequality)
- **Technology** (blockchain, algorithms)
- **Politics** (state power, colonialism)
- **Ecology** (growth limits, resource depletion)
- **Psychology** (behavioral biases)
