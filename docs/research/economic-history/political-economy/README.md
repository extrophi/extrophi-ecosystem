# Political Economy & Critiques

> Heterodox schools questioning mainstream assumptions about power, institutions, and growth

While mainstream economics focuses on individual choice and market equilibrium, political economy traditions examine how power, institutions, culture, and ecological limits shape economic outcomes. These heterodox schools often provide crucial critiques of orthodox blind spots.

### [Mercantilism (1500-1800)](mercantilism.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

### [Development Economics (1940s-Present)](development.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

**Central Question**: Why are some countries rich and others poor?

**Schools of Thought**:

1. **Modernization Theory** (Rostow):
   - Stages of growth: Traditional → Takeoff → Maturity → Mass consumption
   - Western path is universal

2. **Dependency Theory** (Prebisch, Frank):
   - Core-periphery exploitation
   - Underdevelopment is structural, not a "stage"
   - Import substitution industrialization

3. **Capability Approach** (Amartya Sen):
   - Development = expanding freedoms and capabilities, not just GDP
   - Nobel 1998
   - Influenced Human Development Index (HDI)

4. **Poverty Traps** (Jeffrey Sachs vs. William Easterly):
   - Sachs: Foreign aid can trigger takeoff
   - Easterly: Aid often fails; institutions matter more

5. **Randomista Revolution** (Banerjee, Duflo):
   - Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in development
   - Nobel 2019
   - Micro interventions over grand theories

**Key Debates**:
- Aid effectiveness

### [Ecological Economics (1970s-Present)](ecological.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

**Core Premise**: Economy is subsystem of finite biosphere; infinite growth impossible

**Founders**: Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Herman Daly, Kenneth Boulding

**Key Concepts**:

1. **Thermodynamics**:
   - Second law (entropy): Energy degrades, waste accumulates
   - "Cowboy economy" (infinite frontier) vs. "Spaceship Earth" (closed system)

2. **Steady-State Economics** (Herman Daly):
   - Stabilize throughput (resource use, waste)
   - Qualitative development, not quantitative growth
   - "Enough is enough"

3. **Planetary Boundaries** (Johan Rockström):
   - Nine Earth system thresholds (climate, biodiversity, nitrogen cycle, etc.)
   - Already exceeded 6 of 9

4. **Degrowth**:
   - Radical reduction of production/consumption in Global North
   - Redistribution, work-sharing, circular economy
   - Controversial: poverty reduction? Political feasibility?

**Critiques of Mainstream Economics**:
- GDP measures throughput, not welfare
- Discounting future = intergenerational injustice
- Negative externalities (pollution) treated as "market failures" not systemic
- Technological optimism unfounded (Jevons paradox: efficiency → more consumption)

**Policy Proposals**:
- Carbon taxes, cap-and-trade
- Universal basic income (reduce work hours)
- Common-pool resource management
- Circular economy (cradle-to-cradle design)

### [Feminist Economics (1970s-Present)](feminist.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

**Core Critique**: Mainstream economics ignores unpaid care work, gendered power dynamics

**Key Issues**:

1. **Unpaid Labor**:
   - Childcare, eldercare, housework overwhelmingly done by women
   - Not counted in GDP despite being essential for economy
   - Marilyn Waring: *If Women Counted* (1988)

2. **Wage Gap**:
   - Women earn 70-80% of men (varies by country)
   - Explained by: Occupational segregation, discrimination, motherhood penalty, care responsibilities

3. **Care Economy**:
   - Essential work (nursing, teaching, childcare) undervalued
   - Emotional labor unrecognized

4. **Homo Economicus Critique**:
   - Rational agent model assumes male breadwinner
   - Ignores interdependence, care, social reproduction

**Scholars**: Nancy Folbre, Julie Nelson, Marilyn Waring, Diane Elson

**Policy Implications**:
- Universal childcare, paid parental leave
- Social security for caregivers
- Comparable worth (equal pay for equal value work)

**Cross-references**: [Institutional Economics](institutional.md), [Behavioral Economics](../schools-of-thought/behavioral.md)

### [Post-Keynesian Economics (1940s-Present)](post-keynesian.md)
**Status**: 📝 Outline needed

**Relation to Keynes**: Reject neoclassical synthesis; return to Keynes's radical insights

**Key Figures**: Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Hyman Minsky, Steve Keen, Stephanie Kelton

**Core Ideas**:

1. **Fundamental Uncertainty** (not risk):
   - Future is unknowable, not probabilistic
   - Animal spirits, conventions guide decisions

2. **Endogenous Money**:
   - Banks create money via lending ("loans create deposits")
   - Mainstream: Money supply exogenous (central bank controls)

3. **Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis**:
   - Stability → risk-taking → fragility → crisis
   - Debt-deflation spirals

4. **Cambridge Capital Controversy** (1960s):
   - Post-Keynesians showed neoclassical production function inconsistent
   - Neoclassicals ignored defeat, continued using model

5. **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**:
   - Sovereign currency issuers (US, Japan, UK) don't face budget constraints
   - Can print money until inflation, not arbitrary debt limits
   - Full employment via job guarantee
   - Controversial: Inflation risk? Bond market discipline?

**Policy Implications**:
- Fiscal policy primary (vs. monetary policy)
- Financial regulation essential
- Full employment programs
- MMT: Deficits don't matter (until inflation)

**Cross-references**: [Keynesian Economics](../schools-of-thought/keynesian.md), [Hyman Minsky](../figures/minsky.md), [Global Financial Crisis](../crises/gfc-2008.md)

## Why Heterodox Matters

Heterodox schools address blind spots of mainstream:

| Mainstream Ignores | Heterodox Addresses |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Power, class conflict | Marxian, Institutional |
| Unpaid care work | Feminist |
| Ecological limits | Ecological |
| Fundamental uncertainty | Post-Keynesian |
| Institutions, path dependence | Institutional, Development |
| Colonialism, extraction | Dependency theory, Ecological |

**Post-2008**: Heterodox economics gained credibility as mainstream models failed to predict crisis or explain slow recovery.

---

## Common Critiques of Mainstream

1. **Methodological**:
   - Over-reliance on mathematical formalism
   - Unrealistic assumptions (rational agents, perfect competition, equilibrium)
   - Neglect of history, institutions, power

2. **Normative**:
   - Efficiency prioritized over equity
   - Growth fetishism (GDP as sole goal)
   - Market fundamentalism (everything should be commodified)

3. **Empirical**:
   - Failed to predict 2008 crisis
   - Austerity policies worsened recessions
   - Rational expectations contradicted by behavioral evidence

---

## Mainstream Response

- **Incorporation**: Behavioral economics added to curriculum
- **Dismissal**: "Not rigorous" (no math models)
- **Segregation**: Heterodox in separate journals, departments

**Truth**: Pluralism enriches understanding. No single paradigm has monopoly on insight.
