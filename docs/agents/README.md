# Agent Task Documentation

Work logs and outputs from automated agent tasks.

## Purpose

This directory tracks work completed by AI agents (Claude Code instances) to:
- Maintain accountability and traceability
- Document implementation decisions
- Provide learning resources for future tasks
- Track progress on multi-agent projects

## Naming Convention

Agent task documents should follow this format:

```
<project>_<agent-name>_<task>_<date>.md
```

Examples:
- `braindump_alpha_chat-integration_2025-11-16.md`
- `scraper_beta_twitter-oauth_2025-11-18.md`
- `research_gamma_scraperapi-docs_2025-11-17.md`

## Document Structure

Each agent task document should include:

### Header
- Agent name/ID
- Task assignment
- Start/end timestamps
- Status (completed/blocked/in-progress)

### Implementation Summary
- What was built/changed
- Key decisions made
- Files modified

### Challenges & Solutions
- Problems encountered
- How they were resolved
- Lessons learned

### Testing & Verification
- Tests written
- Manual testing performed
- Known issues

### Handoff Notes
- What's next
