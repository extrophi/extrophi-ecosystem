# End of Day Processing - 4D Classification & Automation

**RULE: Run this after your daily brain dump conversation is complete**
**RULE: Create categorized archive artifact and save to filesystem**
**RULE: Use format YYYY-MM-DD_brain_dump_archive.md for filename**
**RULE: ASCII ONLY - No emojis or Unicode characters in markdown files (causes encoding issues)**

Hey Kieran! Time to process today's brain dump and turn chaos into actionable structure.

**Process:** Read through memory A->Z, apply 4D classification to what's actually worth keeping
*The bullshit has been filtered out during the day, this is just the good stuff*

**ARCHIVE CREATION:** Create artifact with categorized summary and save to:
`/Users/kjd/09-personal/BrainDumpSessions/sessions/[DATE]_brain_dump_archive.md`

**MANDATORY FILESYSTEM SAVE:** After creating the artifact, you MUST use the filesystem write tool to save the complete archive to:
`/Users/kjd/09-personal/BrainDumpSessions/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_brain_dump_archive.md` 
*Replace YYYY-MM-DD with today's actual date. This step is REQUIRED - the archive doesn't exist until it's saved to the filesystem.*

**Memory Categories to Review:**
Appointments | Tasks | Business Ideas | Personal Insights | Creative Concepts | Financial Items

## DAILY METRICS RECAP

**First, capture today's tracking data:**

| **Metric** | **Morning** | **During Day** | **End of Day** | **Notes** |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **SUDS (0-10)** | | | | *Stable or variable? Range?* |
| **Energy (1-5)** | | | | *Pattern: rising/falling/stable* |
| **Outlook (1-5)** | | | | *Overall trajectory* |
| **Sleep** | [hours] | | | *Quality: poor/ok/good* |
| **Exercise** | | | [Y/N, duration] | *Daylight exposure?* |
| **Medication** | | | | *Xanax: [count] at [times]; Evening meds: Y/N* |

**Key Observations:**
- Did SUDS spike at any point? What triggered it?
- Did medication/exercise/activity correlate with SUDS changes?
- Environmental factors today (noise, chaos, external events)?
- Any pattern noticed: feel better -> fight/flight reactivates?

## ASCII CHARACTER SUBSTITUTIONS (Use These)
- Use `->` instead of arrows (→)
- Use `[x]` instead of checkmarks
- Use `[ ]` instead of empty checkboxes
- Section headers with `##` not emojis
- Keep formatting clean and portable

**Why:** Prevents UTF-8 encoding issues in Electron/Claude Desktop, ensures portability across editors, simplifies future markdown-to-HTML conversion.

---

**Output Files:**
- **Archive:** YYYY-MM-DD_brain_dump_archive.md -> /sessions/ folder
- Tasks -> Google Tasks export  
- Calendar items -> .ics file or manual entry
- Insights -> Daily timeline entry
- Metrics -> Manual CSV entry (when ready)
- Follow-ups -> CRM/contact system

*Turn today's brain chaos into tomorrow's organized action + permanent categorized archive with trackable metrics.*
